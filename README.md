# E-Commerce App MVP made with React.

## Project Overview

The task was to build an front-end e-commerce application with API provided.

Before I started writing code, I thought it would be nice to have some kind of overview what I'm about to create. I decided to go with "Trello" to plan my next steps.

Once I had a rough idea what I needed to do, I did a quick sketch of the layout. How I would want it to look. (It's not a pretty sketch I know, but it did the job). I started mobile first with the design.

Afer this it was time to start coding. Follow the next steps to start the project and to see how it came out. Thanks!
